# 520-reader

A better name will come soon.

*This repository is created as a partial fufilment of a Bachelor's of Mathematics and Computer Science (Hons.) at the University of Waikato.*

PRs are **not** welcome at this time, as this work will be used in assessment. Some time in 2018, I will open this up.

## What is it?

520-reader is an online eBook reader, that also analyzes the occurences of characters throughout the book. A fair chunk of time spent reading is lost due to the need to recall what those characters did earlier in the book. By showing when a character has been seen, the user can spend more time enjoying the book.
